**Description**

My [freecodecamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com "freecodecamp") project

**Objective** 

Build an app that is functionally similar to this:  [https://wild-song.glitch.me](https://wild-song.glitch.me/).
 Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Stories**

-   As an unauthenticated user, I can login with GitHub.
-   As an authenticated user, I can link to images.
-   As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.
-   As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.
-   As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.
-   As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)

**Hint:**  [Masonry.js](http://masonry.desandro.com/)  is a library that allows for Pinterest-style image grids.
